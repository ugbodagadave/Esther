# Global Coding Standards

## Code Style

-   Always use 4 spaces for indentation.
-   Limit line length to 120 characters.
-   Use descriptive variable and function names.

## Testing

-   All new features must have corresponding unit tests.
- Once a change is made, ensure to run tests on the codebase to ensure nothing was broken
-   Ensure test coverage is above 80% for critical modules.
- Ensure all requirements are clearly defined, unambiguous, and testable from the outset
- Verify designs (system, architectural, module) against their respective requirements before implementation begins
- Prioritize thorough unit testing for individual components and integration testing for modules and subsystems.
- Support system-level testing to validate the complete integrated system against functional and non-functional requirements, and assist in user acceptance testing (UAT).
Maintain clear traceability between requirements, design elements, code, and test cases throughout the development process.

# Security Guidelines

## Sensitive Data

-   Never hardcode API keys or credentials.
-   Always use environment variables for sensitive configurations.

# Documentation Requirements

## README.md

-   Keep `README.md` well detailed and updated with project setup and usage instructions.
-   Include examples for common tasks.
