# Step-by-Step Development Plan for Esther

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a granular, step-by-step development plan for building Esther. The plan is structured into phases, with each phase containing specific tasks, testing requirements, and commit points.

## 2. Overall Architecture
The system will be a modular, service-oriented application deployed on Render's free tier. It will use Python, `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O, MongoDB for data storage, and a combination of Gemini Pro and Flash for AI capabilities.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Interaction

**Objective**: Establish the core bot infrastructure, integrate with OKX DEX for read-only data, and implement simple, non-transactional NLP queries.

| # | Task | Testing | Git Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Project Setup**: Initialize Git, create `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `requirements.txt`. Set up the `memory-bank/` and main application directories. | N/A | `git commit -m "Initial project structure and documentation"` |
| 1.2 | **Telegram Bot Integration**: Implement basic bot functionalities (`/start`, `/help`). Set up message handling for receiving text. | Unit test command handlers. | `git commit -m "feat: Implement basic Telegram bot command handlers"` |
| 1.3 | **Credential Prompt**: Ask the user for the **Telegram Bot Token** and **Gemini API Key**. | N/A | N/A |
| 1.4 | **OKX DEX API Integration (Read-Only)**: Implement an API client to fetch public market data (current prices, trading pairs). | Unit test API client methods for correct data fetching and error handling. | `git commit -m "feat: Integrate OKX DEX API for read-only market data"` |
| 1.5 | **Initial NLP with Gemini Flash**: Integrate Gemini Flash for basic queries like "What is the price of BTC?". Implement intent recognition for `get_price`. | Unit test the NLP module to ensure correct intent recognition and entity extraction for simple price queries. | `git commit -m "feat: Implement basic NLP for price queries with Gemini Flash"` |

## Phase 2: Natural Language Trading & Enhanced Market Analysis

**Objective**: Enable core trading functionalities and provide more in-depth market analysis using Gemini Pro.

| # | Task | Testing | Git Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **Credential Prompt**: Ask the user for **OKX DEX API keys** (with trade permissions). Explain the security measures for storing them. | N/A | N/A |
| 2.1a| **Verify Credentials**: Implement and run a one-time script to make an authenticated API call (e.g., fetch balance) to verify the provided keys. | Manual test. | `git commit -m "feat: Add OKX credential verification logic"` |
| 2.2 | **Database Integration**: Set up MongoDB. Implement a data access layer to manage user profiles and encrypted API keys. | Unit test the data access layer for creating users and securely storing/retrieving encrypted keys. | `git commit -m "feat: Integrate MongoDB for user data and encrypted API key storage"` |
| 2.3 | **Natural Language Trading (Gemini Pro)**: Implement intent recognition for `buy`, `sell`, `swap`. Develop entity extraction for tokens, amounts, etc. Implement the pre-execution confirmation flow. | Integration test the full trading flow: command -> parse -> confirm -> execute. | `git commit -m "feat: Enable natural language trading with confirmation step"` |
| 2.3a| **Implement Dry Run Mode**: Refactor the OKX client and main handler to support a `dry_run` mode for all trading functions. Ensure simulated transaction messages are clearly marked. | Unit test the `dry_run` logic in the OKX client and the message formatting in the main handler. | `git commit -m "feat: Implement dry run mode for trade simulation"` |
| 2.4 | **Enhanced Market Analysis (Gemini Pro)**: Fetch historical data from OKX DEX. Use Gemini Pro to analyze trends and generate concise market summaries. | Unit test the analysis module. Validate the quality of summaries generated by Gemini Pro. | `git commit -m "feat: Add enhanced market analysis with Gemini Pro"` |

## Phase 3: Personalization and Education

**Objective**: Introduce personalized recommendations and a comprehensive educational module.

| # | Task | Testing | Git Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | **Portfolio Analysis**: Implement logic to analyze a user's portfolio (retrieved via OKX DEX API) for asset allocation and P&L. | Unit test portfolio analysis functions with mock data. | `git commit -m "feat: Implement portfolio analysis module"` |
| 3.2 | **Personalized Recommendations (Gemini Pro)**: Develop algorithms to suggest trades or yield farming opportunities based on user portfolio and market data. | Test recommendation logic against various user profiles and market scenarios. | `git commit -m "feat: Add personalized trading recommendations"` |
| 3.3 | **Educational Content Module**: Use Gemini Flash for simple terms and Gemini Pro for complex topics. Create a knowledge base of DeFi concepts. | Unit test the content retrieval logic. Manually verify the quality of explanations from both models. | `git commit -m "feat: Implement educational content module"` |

## Phase 4: External Data and Custom Alerts

**Objective**: Integrate news/sentiment data and build a robust custom alert system.

| # | Task | Testing | Git Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | **Credential Prompt**: Ask the user for a **NewsAPI.org API Key**. | N/A | N/A |
| 4.2 | **News & Sentiment Analysis (Gemini Pro)**: Integrate with NewsAPI. Use Gemini Pro to perform sentiment analysis and summarize articles. | Unit test the news fetching and sentiment analysis pipeline. | `git commit -m "feat: Integrate news and sentiment analysis"` |
| 4.3 | **Custom Alert System**: Develop a system for users to set simple (price) and complex (conditional) alerts. Implement a background monitoring service. | End-to-end test the alert system: set alert -> trigger condition -> receive notification. | `git commit -m "feat: Implement custom alert system"` |

---

## Phase 5: Finalization and Deployment

**Objective**: Implement full portfolio management, optimize the system, and deploy for user testing.

| # | Task | Testing | Git Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | **Full Portfolio Management**: Implement detailed performance reporting (P&L, ROI) and rebalancing suggestions. | Unit test reporting and rebalancing logic. | `git commit -m "feat: Add full portfolio management and reporting"` |
| 5.2 | **System Optimization**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data. Optimize database queries and Gemini API usage. | Performance test the system under load to identify and fix bottlenecks. | `git commit -m "feat: Optimize system performance with caching"` |
| 5.3 | **Deployment to Render**: Create `render.yaml` for deployment. Configure environment variables on Render. Deploy the application. | Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with a group of beta testers on the live Render instance. | `git commit -m "chore: Prepare for deployment and configure Render"` |
