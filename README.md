For a detailed explanation of how we integrated the OKX DEX API, see our [OKX DEX API Integration Guide](./okx_dex_api_integration.md).

## üöÄ How to Get Started

### What You'll Need

-   Python (version 3.9 or higher)
-   A Telegram Bot Token
-   A Google Gemini API Key
-   An OKX DEX API Key, Secret, Passphrase **and Project ID** (required for DEX portfolio and market data endpoints)
-   A PostgreSQL database URL (you can get one for free from Render)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Download the Code:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ugbodagadave/Esther.git
    cd Esther
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Workspace and Install a Few Things:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Add Your Secret Keys:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the main folder and add your secret keys, like this:
    ```dotenv
    # For Telegram and the AI
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"

    # For the OKX Crypto Exchange
    OKX_API_KEY="your_okx_api_key"
    OKX_API_SECRET="your_okx_api_secret"
    OKX_API_PASSPHRASE="your_okx_api_passphrase"
    # The Project ID that groups your keys and quota in OKX Web3 ‚Äì required for portfolio features
    OKX_PROJECT_ID="your_okx_project_id"

    # For the Database
    DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
    
    # A test wallet for practice
    TEST_WALLET_ADDRESS="your_ethereum_test_wallet_address"
    TEST_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="your_ethereum_test_wallet_private_key"
    ADMIN_SECRET_KEY="your_admin_secret_key"
    ```

4.  **Set Up the Database:**
    The app will automatically create the tables it needs when you run it for the first time.

5.  **Start the Bot:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    This will start the bot, and it will begin listening for your commands in Telegram.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

### Demo Mode ("Dry Run")
For safe practice, Esther has a "Dry Run" mode. When it's on, you can simulate trades with real market data without spending any real money. This is the default setting.

To turn demo mode on or off, change the `DRY_RUN_MODE` setting in your `.env` file:
```dotenv
# Set to "True" to practice without real money (this is the default)
DRY_RUN_MODE="True"

# Set to "False" to make real trades on the crypto exchange
# DRY_RUN_MODE="False"
```

### Admin Secret Key
This key is used to protect the new admin endpoint for clearing the database during development.

## üìÑ License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. You can find the full license text in the `LICENSE` file.

## Temporary Admin Tools (For Development)
During development, you may need to clear the PostgreSQL database to reset all users, wallets, and portfolio data. A temporary, secure admin page has been added for this purpose.

To clear the database:
1.  Ensure you have set the `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file or in your Render dashboard. This should be a long, random string.
2.  Visit the following URL in your browser:
    `https://esther-bot.onrender.com/admin/clear-db-page/<your_secret_key>`
    
    Replace `<your_secret_key>` with the secret key you set.
3.  Click the "Clear Database Now" button on the page to confirm the action.

### Running the End-to-End Test
The `e2e_test.py` script is provided to perform live checks against the Gemini and OKX APIs.
It requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `OKX_API_KEY`
- `OKX_API_SECRET`
- `OKX_API_PASSPHRASE`
- `OKX_PROJECT_ID`
- `TEST_WALLET_ADDRESS`
- `TEST_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`

Run the test with:
```bash
python e2e_test.py
```

This will test all major functionality including conversational NLP, portfolio management, and API integrations.
