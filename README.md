## üöÄ How to Get Started

### What You'll Need

-   Python (version 3.9 or higher)
-   A Telegram Bot Token
-   A Google Gemini API Key
-   An OKX DEX API Key, Secret, Passphrase **and Project ID** (required for Explorer & Market endpoints)
-   A PostgreSQL database URL (you can get one for free from Render)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Download the Code:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ugbodagadave/Esther.git
    cd Esther
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Workspace and Install a Few Things:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Add Your Secret Keys:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the main folder and add your secret keys, like this:
    ```dotenv
    # For Telegram and the AI
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"

    # For the OKX Crypto Exchange
    OKX_API_KEY="your_okx_api_key"
    OKX_API_SECRET="your_okx_api_secret"
    OKX_API_PASSPHRASE="your_okx_api_passphrase"
    # The Project ID that groups your keys and quota in OKX Web3 ‚Äì required for portfolio features
    OKX_PROJECT_ID="your_okx_project_id"

    # For the Database
    DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
    
    # A test wallet for practice
    TEST_WALLET_ADDRESS="your_ethereum_test_wallet_address"
    ```

4.  **Set Up the Database:**
    The app will automatically create the tables it needs when you run it for the first time.

5.  **Start the Bot:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    This will start the bot, and it will begin listening for your commands in Telegram.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

### Demo Mode ("Dry Run")
For safe practice, Esther has a "Dry Run" mode. When it's on, you can simulate trades with real market data without spending any real money. This is the default setting.

To turn demo mode on or off, change the `DRY_RUN_MODE` setting in your `.env` file:
```dotenv
# Set to "True" to practice without real money (this is the default)
DRY_RUN_MODE="True"

# Set to "False" to make real trades on the crypto exchange
# DRY_RUN_MODE="False"
```
