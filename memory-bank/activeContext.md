# Active Context: Esther

## 1. Current Focus
The current focus is on **Phase 1: Project Initialization and Documentation Scaffolding**. The primary objective is to establish a comprehensive and robust documentation foundation before any code is written. This aligns with the core principle of maintaining a perfect `Memory Bank` to guide development.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Project Initiated**: The project has been officially started.
- **Documentation First Approach**: A decision has been made to create all core `Memory Bank` documents and supplementary documentation (`prd.md`, `plan.md`, `how-it-works.md`, `README.md`) before proceeding to code implementation.
- **Technology Stack Confirmed**: The core technologies have been documented in `techContext.md`.
- **Architectural Patterns Defined**: Key design patterns and architectural decisions have been documented in `systemPatterns.md`.
- **Deployment Constraint Noted**: The project will be deployed on Render's free tier, which imposes resource constraints that must be considered in the design.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **Complete Memory Bank Creation**:
    *   Create `progress.md`.
2.  **Refine Core Project Documents**:
    *   Create and refine `prd.md`.
    *   Create and refine `plan.md`.
3.  **Create Supplementary Documentation**:
    *   Create `how-it-works.md`.
    *   Create `README.md`.
    *   Create `.gitignore`.
4.  **Proceed to Phase 2 (Code Implementation)**: Once all documentation is in place and approved, begin the initial coding phase as outlined in the development plan.

## 4. Active Learnings & Insights
- A strong documentation-first approach is critical for a project of this complexity, especially given the reliance on external APIs and AI models.
- Acknowledging the constraints of the deployment environment (Render free tier) early in the process is key to designing a viable and robust system.
