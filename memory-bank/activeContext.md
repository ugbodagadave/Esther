## 1. Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing the portfolio rebalance execution feature. The application has been stabilized, and the development is now proceeding with new feature implementation.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Architectural Refactor**: The application has been refactored from a multi-threaded Flask application to a unified `asyncio` event loop using FastAPI. This has resolved the stability issues and created a robust foundation for future development.
- **Deployment Command Update**: The `render.yaml` file has been updated to use `uvicorn` to run the FastAPI application, which is the correct and stable approach for an ASGI application.
- **Portfolio Service Enhancement**: The `suggest_rebalance` function in `PortfolioService` has been enhanced to calculate the `from_amount` in the token's native units, which is a prerequisite for executing rebalance plans.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **Implement Rebalance Conversation Flow**: Continue with Phase 2 of the rebalance feature, which involves creating the `ConversationHandler` logic to manage the sequential execution of swaps.
2.  **End-to-End Testing**: Complete Phase 3 by adding end-to-end tests for the rebalance workflow and updating all relevant documentation.
3.  **On-Demand Education**: Begin work on an integrated learning module to explain DeFi concepts on the fly.

## 4. Active Learnings & Insights
- Decimal precision is a critical detail in DeFi applications. Hardcoding values is risky; dynamic lookup is essential.
- Deployment environments (like Render) can have subtle differences from local setups. Understanding how WSGI servers like Gunicorn interact with `asyncio` applications is vital for debugging.
- A stable development environment is a prerequisite for productive feature development. It was necessary to pause and fix the deployment before other work could continue.
