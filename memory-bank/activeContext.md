# Active Context: Esther

## 1. Current Focus
The current focus is wrapping up the initial development phase and preparing for the next set of features. The core foundation of the bot is complete and stable.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Database Switch**: The project was successfully migrated from a planned MongoDB implementation to PostgreSQL to better leverage Render's free tier.
- **Deployment Issues Resolved**: A series of deployment issues on Render were diagnosed and fixed, resulting in a stable deployment configuration (`render.yaml`) and startup script (`src/main.py`).
- **Live API Integration**: The OKX DEX and Gemini APIs have been successfully integrated and tested with live credentials.
- **Dry Run Mode Implemented**: A critical "dry run" feature was implemented to allow for safe, realistic demos using live market data without executing real transactions. This was prioritized to facilitate investor demos.
- **Model Names Corrected**: The Gemini model names were corrected to `gemini-2.5-pro` and `gemini-2.5-flash` as per the user's explicit instructions and official documentation.

## 3. Next Steps
The immediate next step is to implement the **user confirmation flow** for trades. This involves:
1.  **Using `ConversationHandler`**: Implementing Telegram's `ConversationHandler` to manage a multi-step dialogue with the user after a quote is presented.
2.  **Handling User Response**: Capturing the user's confirmation (e.g., "yes", "confirm") or cancellation.
3.  **Executing the Swap**: If confirmed, calling the `execute_swap` method with `dry_run=False` (though this will initially point to a "not implemented" function).
4.  **Updating the `OKXClient`**: Implementing the real logic for `execute_swap` with `dry_run=False`, which will involve a call to the `/api/v5/dex/aggregator/swap` endpoint.

## 4. Active Learnings & Insights
- A strong documentation-first approach is critical for a project of this complexity, especially given the reliance on external APIs and AI models.
- Acknowledging the constraints of the deployment environment (Render free tier) early in the process is key to designing a viable and robust system.
