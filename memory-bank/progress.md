# Project Progress: Esther

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 1: Project Initialization and Documentation Scaffolding**

The project is in its initial phase. The focus is on establishing a complete and detailed set of documentation before any implementation begins.

## 2. What Works
- The foundational `Memory Bank` structure has been created.
- The core documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been successfully created and populated with initial content.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **Documentation**:
    - [ ] Refine and create `prd.md` with more detail.
    - [ ] Refine and create `plan.md` with granular tasks.
    - [ ] Create `how-it-works.md` for deep technical explanations.
    - [ ] Create `README.md` for project setup and overview.
    - [ ] Create `.gitignore` file.
- **Phase 2: Foundation and Basic Interaction**:
    - [ ] Set up the Python project and environment.
    - [ ] Implement the basic Telegram bot.
    - [ ] Integrate with OKX DEX API for read-only data.
    - [ ] Implement the initial NLP module with Gemini Flash.
- **Subsequent Phases**: All features outlined in the development plan, from trading and analysis to portfolio management and alerts.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **No known issues at this time.**
- **Potential Blockers**:
    - **API Access**: Access to OKX DEX, Gemini, and News APIs will be required. The process for obtaining and securely managing these keys needs to be addressed.
    - **Render Free Tier Limitations**: The constraints of the free tier may become a blocker during later stages of development if the application's resource usage exceeds the allocated limits. This needs to be monitored closely.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions
- The initial decision to adopt a "documentation-first" approach has been validated and is currently being executed. No major pivots or changes in strategy have occurred.
