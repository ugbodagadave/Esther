# Project Progress: Esther

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 3: Feature Expansion**

The project is moving into a feature expansion phase. The "Simple Price Charts" feature has been implemented and is now stable.

## 2. What Works
- **Simple Price Charts**: The new feature to allow users to request and view simple price charts for a given token and time period is fully implemented and working.
- **Complete Project Foundation**: All core documentation (`Memory Bank`, `prd.md`, `plan.md`, etc.) is in place.
- **Telegram Bot**: The bot is live, connects to Telegram, and can handle basic commands (`/start`, `/help`).
- **Database Integration**: The bot successfully connects to the PostgreSQL database on Render to manage users.
- **NLP Integration**: The bot uses Gemini models (`2.5-flash` and `2.5-pro`) to parse user intent for price checks, buying, and selling tokens.
- **Live OKX DEX API Integration**: The bot can make authenticated, read-only calls to the OKX DEX API to fetch live quotes.
- **User Confirmation Flow**: A multi-step `ConversationHandler` is implemented to confirm trades (both buy and sell) with the user before execution.
- **Real & Simulated Swap Execution**: The `OKXClient` can now execute both real and simulated swaps via the `/api/v5/dex/aggregator/swap` endpoint.
- **User Wallet Management**: A secure system for users to add, list, and delete their wallet addresses, with private keys encrypted in the database. Private keys are entered through a secure web app to prevent them from being stored in chat history.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented retry logic for API calls to enhance resilience.
- **Real-time Price Alerts**: A background service (`src/monitoring.py`) is implemented to monitor and notify users of price alerts.
- **Dry Run Mode**: A simulation mode is fully implemented, allowing for safe, realistic demos using live market data without executing real trades.
- **Portfolio Tracking**: `/portfolio` command shows live balances & USD value, backed by periodic background sync.
- **Diversification & ROI Analytics**: Functions provide allocation percentages and 30-day ROI.
- **Rebalance Suggestions**: `suggest_rebalance()` offers a one-hop trade plan to reach target allocations.
- **Rebalance Execution**: The bot can now execute the rebalance plan, guiding the user through a series of swaps.
- **Deployment**: The application has been refactored to use a stable `asyncio`-native architecture with FastAPI and Uvicorn.
- **Advanced Orders**: The NLP model can now understand `set_stop_loss` and `set_take_profit` intents.
- **Personalized Market Insights**: A new `/insights` command provides users with personalized market analysis and recommendations.
- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: The bot now supports trading tokens across different blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon.
- **Portfolio Performance Tracker**: The initial implementation of the portfolio performance tracker is complete.
- **Code Stability**: The entire test suite has been run, and all 55 tests are passing, confirming the stability of the current codebase.
- **Bug Fixes Implemented**:
    - **Price Chart Bug Fix**: Fixed a critical bug where the wrong OKX API endpoint was being used.
    - **Portfolio Performance Tracker**: Fixed a critical bug where the time period was not being correctly parsed from user input.
    - **Architectural Stability**: Refactored the application from a multi-threaded Flask app to a unified `asyncio` event loop with FastAPI, resolving critical stability issues.
    - **Decimal Precision Fix**: Corrected a critical bug causing price quote failures by implementing dynamic decimal precision for API calls.
    - Token resolution for BTC and other symbols is fixed.
    - Price alert response message is corrected.
    - Detailed logging for OKX API endpoints is added.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **On-Demand Education**: An integrated learning module to explain DeFi concepts on the fly.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Begin work on the observer pattern for real-time market alerts.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **Portfolio Performance Tracker**: The feature is not saving historical data.
- **Potential Blockers**:
    - **API Access**: Access to OKX DEX, Gemini, and News APIs will be required. The process for obtaining and securely managing these keys needs to be addressed.
    - **Render Free Tier Limitations**: The constraints of the free tier may become a blocker during later stages of development if the application's resource usage exceeds the allocated limits. This needs to be monitored closely.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions
- The project has successfully navigated its first major debugging and stabilization cycle. The decision to pause feature development to fix critical deployment and API bugs has proven effective.
- The deployment strategy has been temporarily simplified to polling to ensure a stable development environment. The plan is to revisit a more scalable webhook architecture before a full production launch.
