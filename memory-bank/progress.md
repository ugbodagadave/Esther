# Project Progress: Esther

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 1: Project Initialization and Documentation Scaffolding**

The project is in its initial phase. The focus is on establishing a complete and detailed set of documentation before any implementation begins.

## 2. What Works
- **Complete Project Foundation**: All core documentation (`Memory Bank`, `prd.md`, `plan.md`, etc.) is in place.
- **Telegram Bot**: The bot is live, connects to Telegram, and can handle basic commands (`/start`, `/help`).
- **Database Integration**: The bot successfully connects to the PostgreSQL database on Render to manage users.
- **NLP Integration**: The bot uses Gemini models (`2.5-flash` and `2.5-pro`) to parse user intent for price checks and buying tokens.
- **Live OKX DEX API Integration**: The bot can make authenticated, read-only calls to the OKX DEX API to fetch live quotes.
- **User Confirmation Flow**: A multi-step `ConversationHandler` is implemented to confirm trades with the user before execution.
- **Real & Simulated Swap Execution**: The `OKXClient` can now execute both real and simulated swaps via the `/api/v5/dex/aggregator/swap` endpoint.
- **Dry Run Mode**: A simulation mode is fully implemented, allowing for safe, realistic demos using live market data without executing real trades.
- **Deployment**: The application is fully configured for deployment on Render's free tier, with all known issues resolved.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **User Wallet Management**: Implement a secure system for users to add and manage their wallet addresses.
- **Advanced NLP**: Expand the NLP module to handle more complex queries, conditional orders, and other intents (`sell`, `swap`, etc.).
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve resilience and provide more user-friendly error messages, especially for failed transactions.
- **Remaining Phases**: All features outlined in the development plan, including enhanced market analysis, personalization, and custom alerts.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **No known issues at this time.**
- **Potential Blockers**:
    - **API Access**: Access to OKX DEX, Gemini, and News APIs will be required. The process for obtaining and securely managing these keys needs to be addressed.
    - **Render Free Tier Limitations**: The constraints of the free tier may become a blocker during later stages of development if the application's resource usage exceeds the allocated limits. This needs to be monitored closely.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions
- The initial decision to adopt a "documentation-first" approach has been validated and is currently being executed. No major pivots or changes in strategy have occurred.
